Connections

HC05 will be the Master. ELM327 will be the Slave.

Connect HC05 to 5v power and ground and to TX/RX pins of Arduino
Programming

Hold Button before power up to force HC05 into AT command mode.
(Should blink on off every 2 seconds)

Open Serial Monitor or Hyper terminal to COM Port
My ELM327 Address is 12:3.4:56:78:9c:72 ( You need to find yours)

My HC05 Address is 00:14:03:05:97:07 ( AT+ADDE? = +ADDR: 14:3:59707 ) no zeros ( Not really needed )

AT Commands to set up HC05 to connect permanantly to ELM327

AT+RESET
AT+ORGL (Set to original)
AT+ROLE=1 (Set to Master)
AT+CMODE=0 (Set connect to a specific address)
AT+BIND=1234,56,789c72
AT+INIT (Need to connect)
AT+PAIR=1234,56,789c72,20 (,20 means 20 second timeout)
AT+LINK=1234,56,789c72
Note:

When programming Arduino remove HC05 connection from TX RX Pins of Arduino

//Install [claws/BH1750 Library](https://github.com/claws/BH1750) first.


#include <Wire.h>
#include <BH1750.h>

/*

  BH1750 can be physically configured to use two I2C addresses:
    - 0x23 (most common) (if ADD pin had < 0.7VCC voltage)
    - 0x5C (if ADD pin had > 0.7VCC voltage)

  Library uses 0x23 address as default, but you can define any other address.
  If you had troubles with default value - try to change it to 0x5C.

void setup(){

  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Initialize the I2C bus (BH1750 library doesn't do this automatically)
  Wire.begin();
  // On esp8266 you can select SCL and SDA pins using Wire.begin(D4, D3);

  /*

    BH1750 has six different measurement modes. They are divided in two groups;
    continuous and one-time measurements. In continuous mode, sensor continuously
    measures lightness value. In one-time mode the sensor makes only one
    measurement and then goes into Power Down mode.

    Each mode, has three different precisions:

      - Low Resolution Mode - (4 lx precision, 16ms measurement time)
      - High Resolution Mode - (1 lx precision, 120ms measurement time)
      - High Resolution Mode 2 - (0.5 lx precision, 120ms measurement time)

    By default, the library uses Continuous High Resolution Mode, but you can
    set any other mode, by passing it to BH1750.begin() or BH1750.configure()
    functions.

    [!] Remember, if you use One-Time mode, your sensor will go to Power Down
    mode each time, when it completes a measurement and you've read it.

    Full mode list:

      BH1750_CONTINUOUS_LOW_RES_MODE
      BH1750_CONTINUOUS_HIGH_RES_MODE (default)
      BH1750_CONTINUOUS_HIGH_RES_MODE_2

      BH1750_ONE_TIME_LOW_RES_MODE
      BH1750_ONE_TIME_HIGH_RES_MODE
      BH1750_ONE_TIME_HIGH_RES_MODE_2
